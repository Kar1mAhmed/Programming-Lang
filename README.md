# Programming-Lang
Working on implementing an interpreted, dynamically-typed, OOP programming language using Java. I took on this project to improve my knowledge of OOP, data structures, Design patterns and deepen my understanding of programming languages. The goal is to create a better understanding of how programming languages work.
